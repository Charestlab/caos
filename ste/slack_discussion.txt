Hey Kendrick, do you want to share your library of HRFs here, and perhaps some example code? (edited)

These are 20 different HRFs (impulse response), parameterized according to spm_hrf.m.
The figure shows what these look like (if each is normalized to peak at 1).

At some point I will release these materials as part of the NSD data release.  
But you can have these in the meantime.   
Essentially I derive these impulse responses based on the 8 NSD subjects.
The idea, then, is that you can fit a GLM using each of the 20 impulse responses 
(doing the convolution with the length of your stimulus duration) and then for each voxel, 
simply use the GLM results from the model that fit that voxel the best.
See what you think and I can discuss more about the details
Perhaps the hardest/trickiest part is knowing whether or not it did a good thing to your data...  
but that's a separate topic...

ok, and you would then run 20 calls to GLMdenoise one for each, and then for a voxel, pick the max beta? (edited) 
we'll look into it and let you know if we have questions..

Right, that could be a fine approach.  (Pick the GLM with the highest R2 and then for that GLM assign the betas 
from that model to that voxel.)
